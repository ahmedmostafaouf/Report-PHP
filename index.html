                        transactions and integrate with database systems. Through its three-tiered architecture which
                        works on browser, server and database system in a linear manner, PHP offers a reliable solution
                        to achieve these features. As a consequence, PHP is used by over 82% of websites for server side
                        programming; over 244 million websites are built using PHP. Further, web-based enterprise
                        applications and a multitude of Facebook apps are also scripted in PHP.</p>
                    <h3><b>Web Content Management Systems:

                        COM . As a result, PHP has been used for creating popular web Content Management Systems (CMS),
                        including WordPress and its plugins, user-facing portion of Facebook, Joomla, Drupal, Moodle,
                        Silverstripe, MediaWiki, Digg and others</p>
                    <h3><b>php can used in image processing and Graphic Design .
                        </b></h3>
                    <p>Apart from managing text content, PHP can also be used to manipulate images. Integration of
                        various image processing libraries, such as GD library, Imagine and ImageMagick, in PHP
                        applications allows rotating, cropping, resizing, creating thumbnail pictures, adding watermarks
                        and generating output images in multiple formats including jpeg, gif, wbmp, xpm and png. This

                        scatter-dot plots and other means of graphical representations. This feature finds application
                        across client-side desktop applications, eCommerce websites and other applications where data
                        needs to be presented in a concise and graphical manner.Further, by use of a library called
                        PDFLib, PHP can be used to generate PDF files. This can facilitate the creation of an online
                        invoicing system where an HTML-driven invoice is created in PDF format.</p>

                    <p>If frameworks were people, Laravel would probably be the king. If you want to code beautiful
                        designs, you’re looking for Laravel since it’s positioned as the go-to PHP framework for web
                        artisans.The reason for its wide popularity boils down to ease of use and virtually no learning
                        curve. And despite that, it’s a framework developer use for some serious work. So it may seem
                        like a simple tool at first, but it’s a beast when it comes to producing concrete work.Laravel
                        has many inbuilt features which supports rapid application development on any web hosting for
                        PHP. It includes platform’s own templating engine called Blade, local development environment
                        called Homestead, advanced RESTful routing system and many other features.

                    <h2 class="text-center"><b>Why learn PHP ?</b></h2>
                    <p>You have obviously heard of a number of programming languages out there; you may be wondering why
                        we would want to use PHP as our poison for the web programming. Below are some of the compelling
                        reasons.
                    </p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>PHP is open source and free.

                        </li>
                        <li>Short learning curve compared to other languages such as JSP, ASP etc.

                        </li>
                        <li>Large community documentMost web hosting servers support PHP by default unlike other
                            languages such as ASP that need IIS. This makes PHP a cost effective choice.

                        </li>
                        <li>PHP is regular updated to keep abreast with the latest technology trends.
                        </li>
                        <li>Other benefit that you get with PHP is that it’s a server side scripting language; this
                            means you only need to install it on the server and client computers requesting for
                            resources from the server do not need to have PHP installed; only a web browser would be
                            enough.
                        </li>
                        <li>PHP is cross platform; this means you can deploy your application on a number of different
                            operating systems such as windows, Linux, Mac OS etc.</li>
